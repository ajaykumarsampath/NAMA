# NAMA-for-stochastic-optimal-control

In this repository we implement the NAMA (Newton alternating minimisation envelop) for solving the scenario-tree based stochachastic optimal control problem. This algorithm is parallelised for parallel computing hardware like GPU. This repository consists of matlab implementation of the algortihm to ensure `test-of-concept` on a toy example of spring-mass system. Later this algorithm is implemented in CUDA-C++ for GPU. Later this algorithm is tested for two cases - 1) spring-mass example and  2) energy-management system of battery based wind-farm.
